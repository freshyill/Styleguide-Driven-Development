## Design tends to drift

Note: This isn't the huge problem it once was. We're all using source control these days. That's the biggest thing you can do to keep design in check on a single site.

But what if you're *not* building a single site? It's completely common for one site to be composed of several different applications. The example I'm going to focus on, however, is when you have one design that powers multiple sites.
